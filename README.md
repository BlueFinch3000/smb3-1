# Better Boom Booms

Better Boom Booms
---

This simple modification does the following:
1) makes Boom Boom's crouched phase to take a random amount of time, as opposed to being fixed (and so, predictable). 
This small change makes a Boom Boom battle much more difficult.

2) Makes Boom Boom invulnerable to projectiles (fireball / hammmer)
