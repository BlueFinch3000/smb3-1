# Better Boom Booms

---

This simple modification does the following:
1) makes Boom Boom's crouched phase to take a random amount of time, as opposed to being fixed (and so, predictable). 
This small change makes a Boom Boom battle much more difficult.
(This change is found in PRG003.asm)

2) Makes Boom Boom invulnerable to projectiles (fireball / hammmer)
(This change is found in PRG000.asm)
